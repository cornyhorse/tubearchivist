## Core functionality

Once your YouTube video collection grows, it becomes hard to search and find a specific video. That's where Tube Archivist comes in: By indexing your video collection with metadata from YouTube, you can organize, search and enjoy your archived YouTube videos without hassle offline through a convenient web interface. This includes:

* Subscribe to your favorite YouTube channels
* Download Videos using **[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)**
* Index and make videos searchable
* Play videos
* Keep track of viewed and unviewed videos

## Installing

Without Elasticsearch the stack is light: about 1GB of memory is plenty for a mid sized installation (Postgres needs a few hundred MB). Minimal with dual core with 4 threads, better quad core plus.
This project requires docker. Ensure it is installed and running on your system.

The documentation has additional user provided instructions for [Unraid](https://docs.tubearchivist.com/installation/unraid/), [Synology](https://docs.tubearchivist.com/installation/synology/) and [Podman](https://docs.tubearchivist.com/installation/podman/).

The instructions here should get you up and running quickly, for Docker beginners and full explanation about each environment variable, see the [docs](https://docs.tubearchivist.com/installation/docker-compose/).

Take a look at the example [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) and configure the required environment variables.

All environment variables are explained in detail in the docs [here](https://docs.tubearchivist.com/installation/env-vars/).

Both `TA_PASSWORD` and `TA_DB_PASSWORD` can be suffixed with `_FILE` to allow passing in passwords as secrets.

| POSTGRES_DB       | Matching `TA_DB_NAME`, default `tubearchivist` | Required |

### Migrating from stock Tube Archivist

Your media stays where it is; nothing is downloaded again. Keep the old Elasticsearch data
until you are happy with the fork, then going back is just switching the image back.

1. Export Elasticsearch, read only, while the stock stack still runs:
   `ES_URL=http://<es>:9200 ELASTIC_PASSWORD=... python backend/storage/es_export.py /path/to/export`
2. Start Postgres, then in a one-off fork container run:
   `python manage.py ta_connection && python manage.py migrate`,
   `python manage.py ta_import_sqlite /cache/db.sqlite3` (users, tokens, schedules) and
   `python manage.py ta_import_es /path/to/export` (everything else, verified).
3. Start the fork normally.

## Update

Always use the *latest* (the default) or a named semantic version tag for the docker images. The *unstable* tags see [CONTRIBUTING.md#beta-testing](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#beta-testing).

You will see the current version number of **Tube Archivist** in the footer of the interface. There is a daily version check task querying tubearchivist.com, notifying you of any new releases in the footer. After updating, check the footer to verify you are running the expected version.

* This project is tested for updates between one or two releases maximum. Further updates back may or may not be supported. Ideally apply new updates at least once per month.
* There can be breaking changes between updates, particularly as the application grows, new environment variables or settings might be required for you to set in the your docker-compose file. *Always* check the **release notes**: Any breaking changes will be marked there.
* Use the Postgres major version from the provided *docker-compose.yml*.

## Getting Started

1. Go through the **settings** page and look at the available options. Particularly set *Download Format* to your desired video quality before downloading. **Tube Archivist** downloads the best available quality by default. To support iOS or MacOS and some other browsers a compatible format must be specified. For example:

    ```
    bestvideo[vcodec*=avc1]+bestaudio[acodec*=mp4a]/mp4
    ```

2. Subscribe to some of your favorite YouTube channels on the **channels** page.
3. On the **downloads** page, click on *Rescan subscriptions* to add videos from the subscribed channels to your Download queue or click on *Add to download queue* to manually add Video IDs, links, channels or playlists.
4. Click on *Start download* and let **Tube Archivist** to it's thing.
5. Enjoy your archived collection!

### Port Collisions

If you have a collision on port `8000`, best solution is to use dockers *HOST_PORT* and *CONTAINER_PORT* distinction: To for example change the interface to port 9000 use `9000:8000` in your docker-compose file.

For more information on port collisions, check the docs.

## Common Errors

Here is a list of common errors and their solutions.

### Postgres connection

If startup stops at *connect to Postgres*, check that `TA_DB_HOST` resolves from the
TubeArchivist container and that `TA_DB_PASSWORD` matches `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.

### Disk usage

TubeArchivist and Postgres will become all sorts of messed up when running out of disk space. There are some error messages in the logs when that happens, but it's best to make sure to have enough disk space before starting to download.

## Known limitations

* Video files created by Tube Archivist need to be playable in your browser of choice. Not every codec is compatible with every browser and might require some testing with format selection.
* Every limitation of **yt-dlp** will also be present in Tube Archivist. If **yt-dlp** can't download or extract a video for any reason, Tube Archivist won't be able to either.
* There is no flexibility in naming of the media files.
